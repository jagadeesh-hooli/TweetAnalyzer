# TweetAnalyzer
* This is Python project
* Labelled tweets from Stanford dataset are chosen and transformed cleaned using linux vi commands and custome code to form training dataset.
* NLTK library methods were used to perform natural language processing tasks. Panda libraries were used for data loading.
* Feature vector is formed using term frequency. 
* Machine learning model is trained using training dataset and stored in file using Sklearn libraray methods.
* Trained ML model is tested for accuracy and metrics will be printed in console.
* Reads raw tweets from /TempDatafiles/RawTweetsTemp.csv file, classifies and stores them in /TempDatafiles/ClassifiedTweetsTemp.csv file which is ultimately read by TweetProcessor project(repository available with same name in my account) for further processing
